## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
This app is part of the AndroidDevChallenge in order of the beta launch of Jetpack Compose. It
containsa list of puppies, that currently live in shelter and are hoping for an adoption. In
addition, a details screen for every dog is available.
All UI is written with Jetpack Compose.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
I am really fascinated by Jetpack Compose, and am following around since the first announcements.
Because i started working on a Image Library app in my freetime, and am planning to use Jetpack
Compose heavily, this Challenge seems like a perfect opportunity to learn the framework.
In this submission, additional work went into adopting the new animation system. The selection of puppies
in the list reveals a nice transition to a bigger card, so that the user can get a glance at the dog
before continuing to the next screen.
